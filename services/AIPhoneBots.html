      <h3>What are AI Phone Receptionists?</h3>
      <p>
        AI Phone Receptionists are virtual voice agents that answer incoming phone calls, understand spoken language,
        and respond conversationally using synthetic speech. They use speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies
        combined with advanced language models to simulate a live receptionist experience—handling tasks like
        greetings, routing, scheduling, and information capture without human intervention.

      <h3>How will I know if AI Phone Receptionists are right for me?</h3>
      <p>
        If your business receives frequent phone calls that require initial filtering, message-taking, appointment
        scheduling, or routine responses, an AI receptionist can help you save time and improve customer satisfaction.
        It's especially effective for small to mid-sized businesses that want professional call coverage without
        hiring full-time staff or outsourcing to call centers.
