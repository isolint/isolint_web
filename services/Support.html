      <h3>Assigned vs. Licensed Software</h3>
      <p>
        The type of support and ownership you receive depends on whether the software is <strong>assigned</strong> to you
        or <strong>licensed</strong> under usage terms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Assigned software</strong> means you receive full ownership of the codebase and intellectual property. Support can be
          provided as a post-delivery service agreement or transitioned entirely to your in-house team.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Licensed software</strong> means we retain ownership and provide you with usage rights under defined terms. In this
          case, ongoing support, updates, and maintenance are typically included as part of a subscription or service contract.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We'll work with you to choose the model that best aligns with your operational needs, compliance requirements, and budget.
